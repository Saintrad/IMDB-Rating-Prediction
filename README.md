# IMDB-Rating-Prediction

This project is a working model to predict IMDb ratings for a movie using features available prior to the movie's release. The model uses linear regression (Ridge regression, Polynomial regression), and features obtained through scraping movie information from IMDb. I used Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. BeautifulSoup was used for scraping over 8,000 IMDb pages to collect movie data.

It uses features such as Runtime, MPAA Rating, Genre, Director, Writer, Stars, Production Company, Release Month, and Years Since Release.

This model can be a good indicator for producers or movie enthusiasts to understand what rating a movie will get after it is released based on variables that can all be determined prior to the release of the movie.
